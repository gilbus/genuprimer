# genuprim

genuprim is a tool to generate primer for a given sequence and afterwards looking for any matches of them against a desired
collection of sequences. It does so by using primer3 for generating the primer and bowtie for determining any matches.

## Requirements

genuprimer uses and therefore needs [Primer3-py](https://libnano.github.io/primer3-py/index.html) to communicate with primer3. A
quick install guide can be found [here](https://libnano.github.io/primer3-py/quickstart.html#requirements)
